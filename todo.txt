## HIGH PRIORITY

*   [ ] **Investigate and Fix Failing Security Tests:** The security tests are consistently failing; investigate the cause and implement fixes.
*   [ ] **Remove Dependency on drizzle-kit:** Refactor code to eliminate the use of drizzle-kit.
*   [ ] **Remove Dependency on @sveltejs/kit:** Refactor code to eliminate the use of @sveltejs/kit.
*   [ ] **Remove Dependency on @sveltejs/adapter-auto:** Refactor code to eliminate the use of @sveltejs/adapter-auto.
*   [ ] **Implement Card Scanner Microservice:** Refactor the card scanner functionality into a separate, user-facing application.

## MEDIUM PRIORITY

*   [X] **Authentication Improvements**
    *   [X] **Password Reset:** Implement "forgot password" functionality.
*   [x] **Code Improvements**
    *   [x] **API Endpoint Structure:** Review and refactor API endpoints in (src/lib/server/api/) to ensure optimal structure and maintainability.
*   [X] **Performance Optimization**
    *   [X] **Lazy Loading:** Implement lazy loading for images and other resources.
    *   [X] **Optimize Dockerfile:** Improve Dockerfile for card scanner microservice to reduce image size and build time.
*   [x] **Testing**
    *   [x] **Expand End-to-End Tests:** Create Playwright tests for key workflows beyond authentication and deck functionality (e.g., adding cards to collection, creating pods).
*   [ ] **Implement Trading System**
    *   [ ] **Trade Offers:** Allow users to create trade offers for cards.
    *   [x] **Trade Notifications:** Notify users when they receive a trade offer.
    *   [x] **Trade History:** Maintain a history of completed trades.
    *   [ ] **Multiway Trades in a Pod:** Enable multiway trades within a pod, allowing multiple users to participate in a single trade.

## LOW PRIORITY

*   [ ] **UI/UX Enhancements**
    *   [ ] **Design System/Style Guide:** Define a color palette, typography, and spacing scale. Document UI patterns for consistency.
    *   [ ] **Component Library:** Create reusable UI components (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.).
    *   [ ] **Accessibility (A11y):** Use semantic HTML. Provide alt text for images. Ensure sufficient color contrast. Make the application keyboard-navigable.
    *   [x] **Empty States:** Handle empty states with helpful messages and calls to action.
    *   [X] **Card Images:** Optimize card images (consider Cloudinary or Imgix).
    *   [ ] **Drag and Drop:** (Deck Building) Implement drag-and-drop functionality for adding/removing cards.
*   [ ] **Testing**
    *   [ ] **Accessibility Tests:** Integrate accessibility testing into your CI/CD pipeline.
*   [ ] **Performance Optimization**
    *   [ ] **Code Splitting:** Split your code into smaller chunks for faster initial load times.
    *   [ ] **Caching:** Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data.

## CONSISTENT UPKEEP

*   [ ] **Dependency Updates:** Regularly update dependencies to their latest versions to patch security vulnerabilities and improve performance.
*   [ ] **Code Reviews:** Conduct regular code reviews to maintain code quality and identify potential bugs.
*   [ ] **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor application performance and identify areas for optimization.
*   [ ] **Security Audits:** Perform periodic security audits to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities.
*   [ ] **Database Maintenance:** Regularly maintain the database by optimizing queries, cleaning up old data, and performing backups.
